# Yakusoku Ledger

Yakusoku Ledger is a Hyperledger Fabric prototype for recording financial
agreements between students and universities. It provides a full web dashboard,
privacy-preserving document verification, university approvals, immutable audit
history, ledger analytics, and a two-organization Fabric network.

Originally built at CUHackit 2020, the project has been completed and renamed to
**Yakusoku**, the Japanese word for "promise," to reflect the agreements it records.

## Project preview

The dashboard starts with clearly labeled preview records and switches to live ledger
data after identity enrollment.

See [Features and workflows](docs/FEATURES.md) and the [API guide](docs/API.md) for
deeper documentation.

## Features

- Responsive student and university dashboard with live ledger analytics
- Multiple agreements per student/university pair with stable `AGR-...` references
- Exact integer minor-unit money values with explicit ISO currencies
- Student names and emails held in a member-only Fabric private data collection
- Salted public identity commitments and transient-data identity verification
- Client-side SHA-256 document hashing; agreement files never leave the browser
- Draft → student signature → university countersignature → active lifecycle
- Two-party amendments with superseded revision history and deterministic expiration
- Immutable agreement version history and activity notifications
- Role-aware Fabric identity enrollment and network administration
- Single-use expiring invitations, certificate roles, member revocation, and audit events
- Searchable agreement registry with preview mode for portfolio demonstrations

## Architecture

- **University organization:** two Fabric peers and one certificate authority
- **Student organization:** two Fabric peers and one certificate authority
- **Ledger:** Go chaincode backed by CouchDB
- **Web app:** responsive vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript with no package installation
- **API:** Node.js/Express service using the bundled Fabric 1.4.5 SDK
- **Authentication:** enrollment endpoint issuing Bearer JWTs

The chaincode stores random agreement references and non-PII metadata in public
channel state. Student names, emails, and per-agreement salts are distributed only to
the Student and University organizations through a private data collection.

## Prerequisites

This is a legacy Hyperledger Fabric 1.2 application. Use a Linux host or WSL 2 with:

- Docker Engine with the Compose v2 plugin
- Node.js 8.9 or 10.15 (supported by the bundled Fabric 1.4.5 SDK)
- Bash, curl, and jq

The repository includes the Fabric 1.2 command-line binaries used to generate network
artifacts and the Node dependencies needed by the API. They are Linux executables;
no package installation command is required.

## Start the project

To explore the dashboard with preview data before starting Fabric:

```bash
node node1/preview-server.js
```

Then open [http://localhost:4173](http://localhost:4173). Live actions remain disabled
until the complete Fabric API is running.

1. Generate the crypto material and start the Fabric network:

   ```bash
   cd fabric
   ./start.sh
   ```

2. Start the API in another terminal:

   ```bash
   cd node1
   export JWT_SECRET="$(openssl rand -hex 32)"
   node server.js
   ```

3. Confirm that the API is available:

   ```bash
   curl http://localhost:4000/health
   ```

4. Create one-time local bootstrap invitations, then open the dashboard:

   ```bash
   cd node1
   node app/invitation-cli.js create org1 organization_admin 60
   node app/invitation-cli.js create org2 organization_admin 60
   ```

   Enroll each administrator with its returned token at
   [http://localhost:4000](http://localhost:4000).

5. Run the complete enrollment, channel, deployment, invoke, verification, approval,
   and query workflow:

   ```bash
   cd node1
   ./testAPI.sh
   ```

6. Stop the network:

   ```bash
   cd fabric
   ./stop.sh
   ```

`fabric/generate-artifacts.sh` can be run directly to replace all generated
certificates and channel artifacts. Private keys and generated artifacts are ignored
by Git.

## REST API

Except for `GET /health` and `POST /users`, requests require:

```text
Authorization: Bearer <token returned by POST /users>
```

Channel creation, peer joining, installation, and instantiation additionally require an
administrator token. Supply the server's `ADMIN_ENROLLMENT_SECRET` as `adminSecret`
when enrolling the network administrator. Do not expose this secret to normal users.

| `POST` | `/users` | Enroll with a single-use invitation and issue a token |
| `GET/POST` | `/api/members/*` | Manage invitations, members, revocation, and audit events |

| `POST` | `/api/agreements/:id/identity/verify` | Verify an email through transient data |
| `POST` | `/api/agreements/:id/privacy/migrate` | Redact current legacy PII as a Student admin |
| `POST` | `/api/agreements/:id/review` | Approve or reject as a university member |
| `POST` | `/channels` | Create a channel |
| `POST` | `/channels/:channel/peers` | Join organization peers |
| `POST` | `/chaincodes` | Install chaincode |
| `POST` | `/channels/:channel/chaincodes` | Instantiate chaincode |
| `POST` | `/channels/:channel/chaincodes/:name` | Invoke chaincode |

Existing hash-keyed records and legacy `Amount` values remain readable. See the
[privacy design](docs/PRIVACY.md) and [migration guide](docs/MIGRATION.md) before
upgrading a running network.

## Configuration

- `HOST` and `PORT` override the API listener.
- `JWT_SECRET` sets the signing secret. If omitted, a random development secret is
  created on startup.
- `IDENTITY_GOVERNANCE_STORE` places invitation, membership, and audit state on
  durable storage instead of the default `node1/tmp` path.
- `KEY_VALUE_STORE` overrides the Fabric client credential store.
- `TARGET_NETWORK` selects an alternate `node1/app/network-config-<name>.json`.

See [Identity governance](docs/IDENTITY_GOVERNANCE.md) for certificate roles,
bootstrap, revocation, and recovery requirements.
